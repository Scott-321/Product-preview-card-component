## My process

Quick sketch of the containers I though I would need. Next I started organsing the HTML before applying CSS. I styled the fonts and colors first, then when I was happy, I worked on positioning and alignmening the elements on the page. I worked mobile first and added a media query for the desktop layout.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

First time I've used the 'picture' tag. I used it to switch between the mobile and desktop images depending on the screen size. 


### Continued development

Positioning and aligning elements. I'm Looking forward to learning grid.
